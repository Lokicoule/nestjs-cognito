## Why NestJS-Cognito?

### Understanding AWS Cognito Integration Challenges

AWS Cognito presents several integration challenges in NestJS applications:

- **Complex Documentation Structure**: The AWS Cognito documentation spans multiple services and concepts, requiring developers to piece together information from various sources
- **Technical Implementation Overhead**: Direct integration demands extensive knowledge of AWS services, token handling, and security protocols
- **Authentication Flow Complexity**: Managing OIDC flows, JWT token verification, and OAuth2 processes requires significant development effort
- **Error Resolution Complexity**: AWS Cognito's error messages often require deep AWS knowledge for proper interpretation and resolution

### Comparison with Passport.js

While Passport.js serves as a popular authentication solution, NestJS-Cognito offers distinct advantages for AWS Cognito authentication:

- **Specialized Integration**: Unlike Passport.js's generic approach requiring manual AWS Cognito setup, NestJS-Cognito provides dedicated, optimized integration
- **Built-in Token Verification**: NestJS-Cognito includes comprehensive token verification through aws-jwt-verify, eliminating the need for manual implementation required with Passport.js
- **AWS Best Practices**: The library ensures compliance with AWS security best practices, which would require additional effort to implement correctly with Passport.js

NestJS-Cognito addresses these challenges through:

### Developer Experience

- **Clear Documentation**: Practical, focused guides that get straight to the point
- **Intuitive Design**: Following NestJS patterns you already know
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors early with full TypeScript support
- **Smart Defaults**: Best practices built-in, so you can focus on your app

### Enterprise Security

Built on [aws-jwt-verify](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-jwt-verify), offering:

- **Automatic Key Management**: JWKS handling behind the scenes
- **Comprehensive Protection**: Including:
  - Token verification
  - Expiration handling
  - Issuer validation
  - Audience checks
  - Token use verification

### Clean Architecture

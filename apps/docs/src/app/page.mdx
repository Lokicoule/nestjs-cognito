- **Zero Config**: Works right out of the box

## Why NestJS-Cognito?

In the modern landscape of web development, authentication is not just about securityâ€”it's about creating a seamless development experience while maintaining enterprise-grade protection. NestJS-Cognito embodies three core principles:

### Escaping the Cognito Complexity

AWS Cognito, while powerful, is notorious for its steep learning curve and documentation challenges:

- **Documentation Maze**: AWS Cognito's documentation is vast and often fragmented, making it difficult to find relevant information quickly
- **Complex Implementation**: Raw integration requires deep understanding of AWS concepts and multiple service interactions
- **Confusing Terminology**: JWT tokens, OIDC flows, and OAuth2 concepts can be overwhelming for teams new to AWS
- **Error Handling Mysteries**: Cryptic error messages and unclear troubleshooting paths can slow down development

NestJS-Cognito transforms these challenges into a streamlined developer experience:

- **Clear, Focused Documentation**: Straight-to-the-point guides and examples for common use cases
- **Intuitive Abstractions**: Complex AWS operations simplified into developer-friendly methods
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Clear error messages and actionable solutions
- **Best Practices Built-in**: Security and implementation patterns ready out of the box

### Developer-First Philosophy

We believe that great security shouldn't come at the cost of developer experience:

- **Intuitive API Design**: Following NestJS conventions for a natural development flow
- **Type Safety First**: Leveraging TypeScript's type system to prevent runtime errors
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple for basic use cases, powerful for advanced needs
- **Declarative Approach**: Express authentication logic through decorators and guards

### Security by Design

Powered by [aws-jwt-verify](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-jwt-verify), security is baked into every layer:

- **Auto Key Management**: JWKS keys handled automatically
- **Complete Protection**: All essential checks included:
  - Token signatures
  - Expiration times
  - Issuer validation
  - Audience checks
  - Token use verification

### Architectural Harmony

NestJS-Cognito is built to integrate naturally with your NestJS applications:

- **Modular Design**: Follows NestJS's modular architecture for clean code organization
- **Dependency Injection**: Leverages NestJS's DI container for flexible service composition
- **Aspect-Oriented**: Uses decorators and interceptors for clean separation of concerns
- **Framework Alignment**: Maintains consistency with NestJS patterns and practices

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

NestJS-Cognito makes implementing RBAC with AWS Cognito groups seamless:

- **Cognito Groups Integration**: Automatically maps AWS Cognito groups to roles
- **Custom Attribute Support**: Leverage custom attributes for fine-grained permissions
- **Guard-Level Authorization**: Protect routes based on roles or custom claims
- **Flexible Role Checking**: Use decorators or guards for role verification

### Comparison with Passport.js

While Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js, NestJS-Cognito offers several advantages when working specifically with AWS Cognito:

- **Specialized Integration**: Unlike Passport.js which requires manual setup and configuration for AWS Cognito, NestJS-Cognito provides out-of-the-box integration with AWS Cognito services.

- **Built-in Token Verification**: NestJS-Cognito handles all aspects of token verification internally, while with Passport.js, you would need to manually implement token verification logic or rely on additional packages.

- **AWS Best Practices**: By using aws-jwt-verify under the hood, NestJS-Cognito ensures compliance with AWS security best practices, which would require additional effort to implement correctly with Passport.js.

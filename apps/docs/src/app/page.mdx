## Why NestJS-Cognito?

We make AWS Cognito authentication dead simple:

### Built-in Security

Powered by [aws-jwt-verify](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-jwt-verify), security comes standard:

- **Auto Key Management**: JWKS keys handled automatically
- **Complete Protection**: All essential checks included:
  - Token signatures
  - Expiration times
  - Issuer validation
  - Audience checks
  - Token use verification

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

NestJS-Cognito makes implementing RBAC with AWS Cognito groups seamless:

- **Cognito Groups Integration**: Automatically maps AWS Cognito groups to roles
- **Custom Attribute Support**: Leverage custom attributes for fine-grained permissions
- **Guard-Level Authorization**: Protect routes based on roles or custom claims
- **Flexible Role Checking**: Use decorators or guards for role verification

### Comparison with Passport.js

While Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js, NestJS-Cognito offers several advantages when working specifically with AWS Cognito:

- **Specialized Integration**: Unlike Passport.js which requires manual setup and configuration for AWS Cognito, NestJS-Cognito provides out-of-the-box integration with AWS Cognito services.

- **Built-in Token Verification**: NestJS-Cognito handles all aspects of token verification internally, while with Passport.js, you would need to manually implement token verification logic or rely on additional packages.

- **AWS Best Practices**: By using aws-jwt-verify under the hood, NestJS-Cognito ensures compliance with AWS security best practices, which would require additional effort to implement correctly with Passport.js.
